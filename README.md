# kodhus-ui
Kodhus css and javascript UI library.

Checkout https://kodhus.com for more info on how to use this library to build amazing interfaces and web pages.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies by running `yarn install`
2. Start the framework by running `yarn run gulp`. This will open the browser on an empty page.
3. In order to start coding your webpage, open `src/index.html` and start coding your html. The browser automatically updates with your new changes.
4. To deploy your interface/web page, copy the whole public folder content into your web server's root directory.


## Add more pages
### Add html pages
As you can see the structure of `src` folder includes `fonts`, `js`, `scss` and an `index.html`. In order to add more html files, just create them under `src` folder and that's it. They will end up in the `public` folder.
